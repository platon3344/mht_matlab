% Prune cuts less possible hypoes and corresponding state estimations 
% from cellHypo and cellTarg as well as take record of good estimations. 
% 
% Syntax: 
%   [cellEstm, cellHypo, cellTarg] =  Prune(cellEstm , cellHypo, cellTarg, M, N, t, LP)
% 
% In:
%   cellEstm - a cell array containing the state estimation for each 
%       target. The structure of each cell is {idx, startTime, matX}.
%       The startTime is the time step on which the target is confirmed.
%   cellHypo - a cell array of size 1*(1+M+M^2+...+M^N). The structure 
%       of each cell in the cell array is {asso, prob}, where asso is a
%       column vector denoting the assignment of a set of measurements; 
%       prob is a scalar denoting narual log of likelihood of this hypo.
%   cellTarg - a cell array of the same size of cellHypo. Each cell in 
%       the cell array is called oneCase which gives a set of estimations 
%       for all targets according to the correspoding hypo in cellHypo. 
%       The structure of each cell in oneCase is {idx, lifePoint, X, P} 
%       describing one target. 
%   M - number of hypoes generated for one seed hypo
%   N - scan depth
%   t - current time step. Note MHT introduces time delay, so at time 
%       step t we can only confirm things happened at step t-N+1. 
%   LP - the confirmed hypo may contains some tentative targets that are
%       not included in previous estimations (i.e. input cellEstm). If
%       the lifePoints of such targets are not less than LP, then they
%       are confirmed to be new targets. 
%
% Out: 
%   cellEstm - updated cellEstm
%   cellHypo - cellHypo after pruning
%   cellTarg - cellTarg after pruning
